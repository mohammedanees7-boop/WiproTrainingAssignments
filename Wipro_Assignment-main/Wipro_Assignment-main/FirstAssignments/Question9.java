/*9.A shopkeeper sells three products whose retail prices are as follows: 
Product 1 - 22.50
              Product 2 - 44.50 
              Product 3 - 9.98
Write an application that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:
 a) Product number 
 b) Quantity sold

                The application should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for each product. It 
should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold.  */
