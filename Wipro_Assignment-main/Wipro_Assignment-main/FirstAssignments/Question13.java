/* 13. Create a class called Worker. Write classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker that inherit from
Worker. Every worker has a name and a salaryrate. Write method Pay (int hours) to compute 
the week pay of every worker.  A Daily worker is paid on the basis of the number of days 
she/he works. The salaried worker gets paid the wage for 40 hours a week no matter what the
actual hours are.  Test this program to calculate the pay of workers.
