no of eggs in dozen (12 eggs make one dozen) and the no of eggs that is left out remaining. 
The total no of eggs can be got as input through command line. The program should display
how many gross, how many dozen, and how many left over eggs the user has.

Solution Guidance (if applicable): For example, if the input is 1342 eggs, then the program should respond with 
        Your number of eggs is 9 gross, 3 dozen, and 10
